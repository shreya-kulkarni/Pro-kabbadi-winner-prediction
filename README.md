# Pro-kabbadi-winner-prediction
Kabaddi is a game under looked by many machine
learning projects on sports analysis. The Indian sport has less
popularity compared to other worldwide popular games like
cricket, football or basketball. The paper focuses on prediction of
winner “Pro-Kabaddi League” data by analysis and visualisation.
The analysis is done with supervised learning. We are creating
a discriminative model using standard models like Decision Tree
,Logistic Regression, Voting Classifier and Random Forest Tree
algorithms to predict the winner of the league and compare their
performance.
